          imprinted figures

          fleshed by what the mind makes up: <br />
          i know—i had one <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          once
          <br />
          <br />
          —a city clouded
          <br />
          with crowds, flocks of markings etched
          <br />
          in paper, gazing
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          at
          <br />
          <br />
          impressions of sky
          <br />
          implying a place between
          <br />
          there and everywhere,
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          where
          <br />
          <br />
          people could be both:
          <br />
          ideal perspectives of
          <br />
          ordinary scenes,
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          because
          <br />
          <br />
          they are made for you
          <br />
          and of you, for you to see

          yourself reflected
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          like
          <br />
          <br />
          your face in the mirror,
          <br />
          layered by each returning,
          <br />
          yet still just as flat:
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          after
          <br />
          <br />
          all the prints you’ve bought
          <br />
          to fill yourself with yourself,
          <br />
          the art is reduced <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          to
          <br />
          <br />
          mere appearance: why
          <br />
          i believe my images,
          <br />
          but not my belief:
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          for
          <br />
          <br />
          this print isn’t mine; <br />
          it’s foreign; that is, not some
          <br />
          thing i’ve really seen:
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          just
          <br />
          <br />
          something that i dreamed
          <br />
          and stuck between wall and air
          <br />
          to keep me comfort—
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          but
          <br />
          <br />
          when i woke, it had <br />
          already fallen: perhaps <br />
          weighted by paper
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          or
          <br />
          <br />
          brushed by me asleep;
          <br />
          so i stared at the hangings
          <br />
          before turning away,
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          always
          <br />
          <br />
          going forward: find
          <br />
          some other dream, other theme,
          <br />
          as if the whole point
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          is
          <br />
          <br />
          keeping it floating
          <br />
          —perhaps that’s why i resist
          <br />
          anything defined,
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          as
          <br />
          <br />
          future flutters me,
          <br />
          ream of self-seeking portraits
          <br />
          keeping layers aligned
          <br />
          <br />
          <tab />
          in
          <br />
          <br />
          language’s flatness: <br />
          if you ask for something deep,
          <br />
          i’ll just write a poem.

          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to round curves of coast,

          <tab /> until he finds the half-falling way

          the breaks in waves pounding stones to multiplicity—

          &emsp;
          <tab />
          <tab />
          remembering how he left his son who now wishes me

          &emsp;to continue my “legacy”

          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          <tab />
          <tab />
          <tab /> into what—the way I’d codify
          <br />
          these impressions into something to impress,
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to pass
          <br />
          on—to progeny or “audience,” this raw consciousness
          <br />

          in something,
          <br />
          because it’s all been lateral, and now
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the experts said
          they’ll put him under for an operation
          <br />
          so he leaves us with three forms to fill out,
          <br />
          &emsp;
          <tab />
          and the image of us three smiling
          <br />
          with me in between,
          <br />
          &emsp;
          <br />
          our eyes squeezed between sun and the same uncomprehending flame,
          <br />
          the same aging realization,
          <br />
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;that in figuring eternity,
          everything&emsp;
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is passed down incomplete;
          <br />
          <br />
          that I will return&emsp;
          <br />
          wishing for more of his language
          <br />
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I always thought myself too young
          to understand.
