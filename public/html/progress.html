  Mysticism is overrated. you go <br />
      through it,<br />
  and then your hair is dyed red.<br />
  <br />
        i wake up every day<br />
      &amp; brush your hair in front of your eyes,<br />
    so as not to wake you. Plato put us in the cave<br />
  <br />
  &amp; we became grapefruit-skulled exotica,<br />
    skulls destined for a museum<br />
        (but it's better than for the dust again):<br />
  <br />
               as Gen 3:19 or something like that, would say. <br />
     my room is dirty. i sweep it<br />
       once in a while, &amp; sometimes find earrings sparkling<br />
  <br />
            like little stars<br />
        —the bones of little stars<br />
      —the little bones of starts that we <br />
  <br />
              burned when it got to be winter,<br />
  &amp; then swept under the rug. actually i think it's worse than dying: you<br />
       dream charcoal. you dream without dreams,<br />
  <br />
     a lily waiting to be plucked &amp; personified. you will wilt<br />
  when the seasons change, &amp; then—<br />
        by God—<br />
  <br />
                we will be green. sometimes,<br />
  your arms feel like scales. whatever we weigh in the end,<br />
        it will not be enough.<span style="display: none"

  where the words are all <br />

      together. oh, i started writing<br />

              another one, but it was shit.<br />
  perhaps not—<br />

    periodically,<br />

        like a dance between self &amp; ocean. sharks<br />
  die if they stop moving (perhaps that's<br />
           why they've been around for so many millions of years)—<br />
  <br />
          like words<br />
  which, if not to lose their weight at the marketplace,<br />
      must become coined repeatedly. You cloy<br />

  a skeleton always wrapped in fantasy: a dream<br />
        (there's that word again, <br />

        value, different motion<br />
    towards gold (or cold)<br />
  <br />
                as my head is plunged in water &amp; i wake,<br />
  choking on a dime. i'm fine, that is, that our shark never swam—<br />
  <br />
            i see it now as an extinction, a productive<br />

        and as the author writes himself into the script,<br />
            we are transfixed by his trickery.<br />
  <br />
      then,<br />
  the blanket is pulled. we love you, but<br />
        why do have you namesaked us<br />
  <br />
            only to let us drown? (my blanket<br />
          dragged through mud comes up<br />

            for a whale. i tied knots,<br />
  <br />
    figuring notes in my head: they resonated inwards,<br />
          embryonic. the whale dives so deep, that spout<br />
      is its exhale. i wish i could've seen that,<br />

    but when i lined up with grandpa the silhouette on the water<br />
        staring out, was all i could see. every egg<br />
          comes back up for air.

  <br />
          All i wanted! life was simple. i had<br />
  an Imaginary friend, &amp; He would take Care<br />
    to make such Wonderful games, <br />
  <br />
  leaving eggs under cushions &amp; bushes, <br />

    someone is behind me in line to squeeze<br />

    of this arcade of distant fire, &amp; long<br />
          for that primeval fog, way West,<br />
  <br />

    with feathers. it was you, all along, <br />
          that flightly companion,<br />

  that well-placed pun with leaving,<br />

                (the cycles, perpetual). you will<br />
        spread your wings, little bird, &amp; when you sing,<br />
    you will feel like you're flying. except<br />
  <br />
               that the feathers' sheen is the sinister<br />

        in some exclamation, the archaeologist<br />
    remembers a childhood toy, digging among the dirt,<br />

  about this, this perfectly preserved death, kept <br />
     in the moment of mummification<br />

  <br />
            a prophet (thank you very much)<br />
          whose rings sparkle with imagination. we are at that age now,<br />
        where the fantastic becomes the fantastical—<br />
  <br />
  but since you asked, it's the other way:<br />
       a bird flaps its wings &amp; the Wright brothers<br />
    fly on paper, &amp; now i've written so many news stories<br />
  <br />
                about their ascent. but these planes need remodeling:<br />
    the prophet has TB, &amp; we are clasping the blood<br />
        on his hankerchief. You are a leech:<br />
  <br />
  the congregation surrounds, holding snakes,<br />
    speaking in ways that violate the quotidian,<br />
  and they are bitten once again. Propheteering,<br />
  <br />
          as schools can charge tuition. one pays<br />
  to find oneself, &amp; if i were Shakespeare, i would<br />
    have reached down for some choice words. but alas,<br />

            out of Nothing, I am born.<br />
  I hover over water, &amp; breathe life.<br />
  i stand over vapor, &amp; breathe strife.<br />
  <br />
  now there are subjects. this is the age<br />
  i'm at: <br />
    a bunch of clusters spinning themselves<br />
  <br />
        into sequence. i ride my bicycle,<br />
           grow a motor, streaks,<br />
            lurch, am i having a heart attack,<br />
  <br />
      or a kerouac? for that's the Word now,<br />
            the world is larger, &amp; we get to speak for ourselves—<br />
        careening through these rounds,<br />
  <br />
  and the reverb echoes, or the ripper,<br />
        Jack, spurs screams &amp; heart attacks,<br />
    sneaks up on showers—&amp; is it that<br />
  <br />
              who we run from, or is it you<br />
        starring in the movie? to be honest,<br />
           my knowledge is shoddy at best. i've stepped in<br />
  <br />
    and missed the Beats,<br />
  can't keep time, nobody rhymes anymore &amp; instead<br />
          i'm expected to say something <br />
  <br />
                   sublime—which is really lying—<br />
        because your eyes shining out of the screen<br />
      as you sing along to as time goes by<br />
  <br />
          seem to articulate something without a world<br />
        yet, only a word<br />
      speaking out of darkness, the screen for the first time alive.

  <br />
        come dance with me,<br />
      you painted lady. let me <br />
            be enframed, as snow catches a figure,<br />
  <br />
    &amp; dance myself into a fragmentation<br />
        of so many individualities that they blend with yours,<br />
          a gradient: let me spin you into pixels,<br />
  <br />
                assembled from recursion<br />
          until the small symbols capture meaning<br />
      in knots &amp; strings; let me see,<br />
  <br />
            let my light-sensing cells make you into dot,<br />
      then line, then curve, then shape,<br />
              until we are writing each other poetry<br />
  <br />
    (in between the basic activity). you are my mother,<br />
          to whom i will return<br />
        as womb awaits tomb:<br />
  <br />
            we are watercolors painted to resemble<br />
       us. &amp; soon, the sunset separates us<br />
        within undifferentiated dark, lines<br />
  <br />
          subsumed to chasms, the true<br />
        subject of art. although my brush is caked with layers,<br />
                 the canvas remains flat.

        welcome;<br />
      welcome back?<br />
  we've been going awhile now.<br />
  <br />
  we haven't confused the order;<br />
        the shipment is on its way,<br />
         &amp; in fact, the technology now allows us<br />
  <br />
      to predict what you want. You are our most valued <br />
          Customer: we will capitalize<br />
        you, the reason for our existence.<br />
  <br />
    in fact, it's me speaking here, <br />
        the Personal; i've been thinking about <br />
      how to say this for awhile now, <br />
  <br />
    to personalize. for example, your hair,<br />
          it's like Campbell's soup, the colors just pop,<br />
        Marilyn, you are a true beauty.<br />
  <br />
        i will make your face The face,<br />
      this is the service we provide. we are onlookers,<br />
          we help you be seen. isn't that the real dream?<br />
  <br />
                this is the truth: you want to know us<br />
        above all else, for we will know you<br />
               —soon, i promise, the Arrival is arriving soon.

  two, zero. i am creating a clone<br />
          here, of myself. i am an egg,<br />
      and you are the bearer, an electric lace
</p>
<p>
          to hold his emptiness. <br />
              the genes fray, if kept too long in incubation.<br />
     they must be harnessed tightly,<br />
  <br />
                energetically, &amp; subtly, but then<br />
  released if you want to publish: an amoeba<br />
        that splits itself in two,<br />
  <br />
              one mind on the internal struggle<br />
                and the other on you.<br />
    that is, until we figured out how to replicate<br />
  <br />
              your every curve exactly:<br />
    it is birthed from algorithm now, the artist's steady hand<br />
            handing you over to Practice,<br />
  <br />
  that overhaul which makes you perfect<br />
        by isolating Parameters. that final couplet,<br />
    in Pentameters, to synthesize &amp; invert<br />
  <br />
              everything that came before:<br />
        the done bests, the backslides, the false-compare belies,<br />
    which was all an incubation<br />
  <br />
            for the beast, slouching towards better-than<br />
    to be, after all that advancement,<br />
            bored.

  <br />
  a man climbed to the top of a mountain<br />
  searching for eternal life. he found you<br />
        slid under a rock, <br />
  <br />
    your garment collapsed like a snake-skin<br />
                slid out of. the garment is the snow,<br />
        &amp; i am in a graveyard, <br />
  <br />
        waiting for the rain. this is why they danced,<br />
    originarily. to shift the sunlight into clouds,<br />
          for the life-giving spirit. but all you gave us<br />
  <br />
  was epitaph. and said that this<br />
        was a good start, although the final grade <br />
    awaits our passing.<br />
  <br />
            the past awaits the future. we suture<br />
        these wounds with your scraps, perhaps too much,<br />
      for when you left, was there cover-up? when the cave<br />
  <br />
     was wet with liquid, reflecting<br />
        from the other side something, but only light,<br />
      the evidence of an opening.

  <br />
    it won't be long now. the wave<br />
        is coming. it will be a great <br />
    sequence, the peak, the crash<br />
  <br />
          against the beach. my hands before me, having lifted<br />
        out of the water, will finally<br />
        hold something concrete: a fragment of evidence<br />
  <br />
  that the great cities may have been fabricated—some sign-<br />
    post along highways. but too much specificity<br />
          would preclude the eventual accuracy <br />
  <br />
          of this prediction. we wait instead<br />
    for A sign, the indefinite, and perhaps<br />
        this is why we make myths<br />
  <br />
            at all. my poetry is presumption. <br />
  How Long can you string out a single concept?<br />
        until, eventually, you reach back to the beginning<br />
  <br />
          (that is, the end): extinction. the opening<br />
    is not light. it is death, to pave the way for progress. <br />
          we write the same way, but now it is not with oil,<br />
  <br />
  or stone, or even sound. it is with the past.<br />
    after we burn ourselves out, they will read us.

  <br />
       i'm 23. you see,<br />
     that's why i wrote this sequence<br />
             (to be 23)—<br />
  <br />
              both me &amp; the sequence,<br />
               or perhaps for me to earn it, 23.<br />
         between the threes, <br />
  <br />
    the sea: the canon-blasting,<br />
        caustic waters, <em>Coup de Dès</em>. the boards are struck<br />
      &amp; replaced, one by one, revised<br />
  <br />
          until when one revisits the ship, one can't be sure<br />
      if one stands on the solid Ground of Being, or if metaphysics <br />
    is merely abyss waiting for meteor.<br />
  <br />
        there's Extinction again,<br />
      as of course i've been three times around<br />
            that seven-year cell-marking<br />
  <br />
                  where all my post-prokaryotes<br />
           are replaced. so what's left then—<br />
      direction? oh, no, for if you've made it to the end of this<br />
  <br />
                you clearly aren't one of those types.<br />
    then maybe, <em>typing</em>, the Irony,<br />
          where words are types, &amp; are also all these little letters.<br />
  <br />
  maybe You: for really, i'm writing this to(wards) You—<br />
       &amp; in that sense, You've made me<br />
              make myself<br />
  <br />
                (for you), as image slowly becomes<br />
               me.. <br />
               i'm aged. <br />
  <br />
      the irony, yes, me at 23, writing that—<br />
    later, i'll read that &amp; think oh, it wasn't all that.<br />
              but it was <em>that</em> that, the <em>the</em> of Stevens<br />
  <br />
        who first heard the truth while plumbing the dreamy dumps. so later,<br />
       the progress will be in the waking up<br />
    of <em>that</em> word, implying the previous <em>that</em> was a dream,<br />
  <br />
          but in that, not wasted, as<br />
          that Eliot's land wasn't Wasted<br />
           no matter how many Pounds one's weighed. yes, Puns, but <br />
  <br />
  i do believe in Somethings. Rejoyce, for we will wake Finnagains, <br />
         the <em>s</em> denoting not possession, but Plural:<br />
      plural as one, as those two plums in the icebox<br />
  <br />
                ingesting in this poetic stomach—<br />
           &amp; it's good, that I'm still hungry,<br />
  &amp; i hope you are, because—thank God—there's more where <em>that</em> came
  from.
