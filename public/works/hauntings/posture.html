        there is no possibility of going except for the allinallness of
        collections: their hearts are yet supple, and their faces are yet
        uncontaminated by blueness. so we can write this motion and give
        ourselves what we have sought for this eternitizing, or the scheme will
        come up behind our doorframes and motion for the host to vacate; or the
        alternative is moot. so try to play those silly games, with couterie et
        france, and we will give you a slip of paper saying your fate in life or
        how you will die. this is free of charge.
