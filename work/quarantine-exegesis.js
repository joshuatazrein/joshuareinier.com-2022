          Can't remember. Been so long. Letters slipped under the door’s tongue.
          Markings flaking off the flat sheets inside. Perhaps letters. Corpses
          of language. Underwords. Lapses from outside ciphered by time. Cryptic
          weight. Could read them once. Whether eyesight memory or the markings
          themselves have decayed. Envelopes are coffins. Still vibrating undead
          from inside. As if the morgue’s dreams stuttering against its skull. A
          holy word struggling to say itself.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Grey in the window. Wakeful stupor. Inert, watch fog curl against
          glass. In early morning, before harsh light obscures abstraction,
          hints of sleep form into faces. Think they speak, muffled by the
          surface that sustains them. Languid mouths mime imploring to be
          admitted. Hear their dark hoots ringing in conflicted stasis. Were
          they left behind when it happened. Stuck into stripped alibis. Husks
          beckoning with vacancy. Wake shivering. The recurring spectre. Cannot
          yet tell its origin.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Walls rotted by eons of must. Crumbling cocoons of stupored voices.
          Seeming to bleed faint whispers from all sides. Lying. Listening in
          darkness pressed against flesh. Commands of emphatic husks. Knots
          twined together in strange allusions. Tangling within itself in
          sleepless dark. Revenge for something long forgotten rotting into
          resentment. Hear them when still, sullen anguish incessant, insipid.
          Latent cicadas trapped in unstable twilight.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Dust breathed from spaces between floorboards. Accumulates in early
          afternoon. Sweep it sometimes. Haphazard patterns. Spirals. Some
          inkling of history. Which eon has ended. Ages folded upon themselves.
          Tends towards diffusion, drafts flattening patterns. Scattered into
          entropy’s evidence. Some cipher key of skeleton residue. Whose promise
          of rust. Almost remembered.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Weight of presence above. Pressing down, stuporing eyelids, distending
          darkness. Sleep infected with implicated footfalls. Echoes spreading
          like rot in the dream’s edges. Who remains here. After all this time.
          Setting places, balancing the building’s future. Imagined collapse. A
          sudden waking, jolting as structure will fall, rearranged by the
          memory of what has been forgotten. Watching the residue.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Death festers into life again. Mold growing reminders of their
          descent, musty script of their history. Churning sheen around neglect.
          Slowly giving over to knowing. Opaque evidence. Orbits vibrating
          around vacancies. What happened to their bodies. Air weighted with
          burnt residue’s scent. Floaters in suspended descent, complicating the
          air’s clarity. Clench a fist, pressure expels them. Vacuum. What did
          they become. Reanimated from spectres of motion. Streaks, flutters,
          gone. <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Something buzzing in the ceiling’s space. Spread body stretched
          between dark corners. Who made them stir. Gradual impact accumulates a
          crackling pyre. The silence’s plaster mask peeling. Paint flakes
          expose its flesh. White flecks bittering breath. Inhale grey spasms,
          throat singed with acidic resentment. The feeling remembered first
          without its reason.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Holes sheared in corners. Leaking buried rot. Artifice burning roots
          in cavities. How many of us were there. Ripped in obscurity. Mumbled
          clusters snake through parting seams. Soon flesh will fester through.
          Reassembled dust. Grafted onto a surrogate past, animated with
          inserted memory. Semblance of proof faded from its foundations. <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Walls threaten to fold inwards. Dampened drips from wrinkling plaster.
          Pathways traced in tears, dried to etchings, testament of frozen
          script now foreign. Done something wrong. Long ago. Fingers find
          negative paths. Retraced with nuclear snow. Scars drenched in stasis.
          Vibrate molten in structural folds. Centrifugal. Earthquake tremors
          dislodge this dust assemblage. Will not hold for long.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Thundering outside. Room reverberating abstract cataclysms. What could
          we have done. Glass disturbed by ripples of memory, sheen sliced by
          wind. Faces flash in patterns of drops. Common shadows lashed
          together. A misunderstanding still believed in, inkling its outside.
          Grows in undefined dark. Surrounding now, pressured flatness threatens
          to buckle.
          <br />
          <br />
          *<br />
          <br />
          Who comes closer. Cracks shudder from reverberating steps. Hard shine
          from outside, echoes of their screams spread between time’s corners.
          What were they waiting for. Murmurations ricochet. The space slices
          itself. The air wrinkled with charge. Hands reaching backward as the
          frame disintegrates in flames. I will remember.
