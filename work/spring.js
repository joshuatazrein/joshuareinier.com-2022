        <Explanation>
          The original text in this piece mixes German and English to create a
          fragmentary poetics, conjuring up the mad poet HÃ¶lderlin amidst images
          of death and renewal. The proportional score requires players to step
          around and over each other, holding the silences between events as
          integral to the progression of time. A vague serialism suspends the
          harmonic language, always alluding to tonality but receding back until
          the final duet between voice and cello, in which a twisted major scale
          emerges.
